But, you should give each child at most one cookie.</p><p>Each child <code>i</code> has a greed factor <code>g[i]</code>, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie <code>j</code> has a size <code>s[j]</code>. If <code>s[j] &gt;= g[i]</code>, we can assign the cookie <code>j</code> to the child <code>i</code>, and the child <code>i</code> will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.</p><p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p><p><strong>Input:</strong> g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]</p><p><strong>Output:</strong> 1</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content. You need to output 1.</p><p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p><p><strong>Input:</strong> g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]</p><p><strong>Output:</strong> 2</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, You need to output 2.</p><h2 id="constraints" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#constraints" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Constraints</h2><ul><li><code>1 &lt;= g.length &lt;= 3 * 104</code></li><li><code>0 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 3 * 104</code></li><li><code>1 &lt;= g[i], s[j] &lt;= 231 - 1</code></li></ul>',12);function p(m,_){const t=r("ExternalLinkIcon");return s(),c("div",null,[e("h1",h,[l,o(),e("a",u,[o("455.
