# ICCI 17.16 the masseuse

A popular masseuse receives a sequence of back-to-back appointment requests and is debating which ones to accept.

She needs a break `between appointments` and therefore she cannot accept any adjacent requests.

Given a sequence of back-to-back appointÂ­ ment requests, find the `optimal` (highest total booked minutes) set the masseuse can honor.

Return `the number of minutes`
