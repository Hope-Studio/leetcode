# 7. Reverse Integer

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

**Note:** Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2<sup>31</sup>,  2<sup>31</sup> − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
